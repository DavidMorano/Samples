This repository provides some sample documents, talks, and code.

Some of the documents have been published and others may not have been. The
talks are usually one of either seminar presentations or university class notes
for when I taught university classes (undergraduate and graduate). The code is a
relatively small sameple, principally derived from the RightcoreMainBase
repository on GitHub.com/DavidMorano.
