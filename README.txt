This repository provides some sample code, documents, notes, talks, and
manual pages.

Some of the documents have been published and others may not have been. The
talks are usually one of either seminar presentations or university class notes
for when I taught university classes (undergraduate and graduate). The code is a
relatively small sample (but at least 250k LOC), principally derived from the 
RightcoreMainBase repository on GitHub.com/DavidMorano.
